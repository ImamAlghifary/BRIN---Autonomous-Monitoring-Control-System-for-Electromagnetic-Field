# BRIN-Autonomous-Monitoring-Control-System-for-Electromagnetic-Field
A real-time environmental monitoring system developed during my internship at BRIN (Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional). This project focuses on the autonomous acquisition, processing, and visualization of electromagnetic field (EMF) data using GNSS and SignalHound sensors

## Step by Step:
- You can just download all the zip and file
- Follow the step inside README inside Zip  

## Signalhound (SA44B)

## Tech Stack:
- Node.js – Middleware for handling GPS data and inserting it into PostgreSQL
- Python – Data acquisition and processing script for SignalHound frequency sweeps
- PostgreSQL – Database for structured sensor data storage
- MQTT – Lightweight communication protocol for transmitting sensor data
- Grafana – Real-time dashboard for data visualization
- Docker – Deployment setup using containerized services
